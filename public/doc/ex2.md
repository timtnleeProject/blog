# How to Avoid Emotional Outbursts and Save Your Relationships

These are the moments you can’t take back.

I had apologized. My apology had even been accepted. At least half-heartedly. Still, it was days later, and I could barely stop thinking about it. I played the incident over and over in my head.

Had I really told that junior engineer that what he’d just shared in the project review might be the stupidest idea I’d ever heard?

I had.

Sure, I said it half-jokingly. But only half. And nobody laughed.

It bothered me during the whole 45-minute drive home and during commutes for the next several days. And between meetings. And whenever I passed the junior engineer in the hallway. And before I fell asleep at night.

In hindsight, it was explainable. Not excusable, but explainable.

His was the last review in an all-day series of critical project reviews. Things hadn’t been going well. Most of the projects were at status code yellow, and many were at red. Nobody really seemed to care about how far behind we were. I was frustrated.

To top it off, I had skipped lunch to meet with several others for ad hoc discussions following up from the morning’s sessions.

In other words, it was the perfect set of conditions for an amygdala hijack.

## Our Lizard Brains Are Small but Mighty

Daniel Goleman first coined the term “amygdala hijack” in his groundbreaking 1995 book, Emotional Intelligence.

Goleman was referring to the state where we’ve essentially lost our mind, reacting to emotion in the fight-or-flight, stimulus-response manner that once kept us from being devoured by sabre-toothed tigers and still keeps lizards from being devoured by whatever devours lizards.

We have two of these little fellas (the plural is amygdalae), one in each hemisphere of our brain. They’re buried deep, well past the higher-functioning stuff within our skull that helps us think logically and rationally, well past the stuff that keeps us from calling a relatively new employee stupid.

Our amygdalae compose a part of our brain that we share with the rest of the animal kingdom. They’re responsible for keeping us out of life-threatening situations via that fight-or-flight response. This requires our amygdalae to help us make decisions very quickly. Faster decisions made it less likely for our evolutionary ancestors to end as bits stuck between a predator’s teeth.

While our amygdalae are busy helping us make snap judgments and encouraging us to rely on gut instinct, the rational part of our brain is trying to keep those impulses under control—trying to keep us from succumbing to the raw, sometimes animal nature of our emotional brain. This rational thinking happens in the prefrontal cortex, the area of the brain located right behind our forehead.
